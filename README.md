# Description

The purpose of this project was to build an application that shows the current weather data for a searched city, while also showing its forecast for the next 5 days. Doing this helped me learn the use of web APIs, while also reinforcing my familiary of third party APIs, such as bootstrap and and Dayjs. Most, if not all of the CSS was made using bootstrap in order to provide an acceptable aesthetic layout. Doing so helped direct the focus onto the logic of this app, the javascript.

# Usage

When you first enter the app, you should see various titles, such as current weather and 5-day forecast. To start using the app, go to section labeled "Search For A City". If the city was spelled wrong or the city does not exist, a modal will pop up telling you to make sure to spell the city correctly. Otherwise, entering in a name of city will fetch data from the API to show the current weather for the searched city, along with a 5 day forecast. Details include temperature, wind, humidty, and and an icon showing whether it is raining, cloudy, or sunny etc. You will also notice that if sucessfuly searched, the name of the city will pop up in the Recent Searched Cities section. Clicking on it will refetch the data for that city. The section holds up to 8 of your last searched cities, and searching the same city will move it up to the top of the list. Another thing you will notice is that if you reload or return to the website later, the weather details for your most recent searched city will already be loaded.
